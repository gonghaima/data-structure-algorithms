# O(n!) - Factorial time

Factorial is the multiplication of all positive integer numbers less than itself. For instance:

>>5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

It grows pretty quickly:

>>20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000

As you might guess, you want to stay away if possible from algorithms that have this running time!
