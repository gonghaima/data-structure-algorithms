# O(1) - Constant time

O(1) describes algorithms that take the same amount of time to compute regardless of the input size.

For instance, if a function takes the identical time to process ten elements as well as 1 million items, then we say that it has a constant growth rate or O(1). Letâ€™s see some cases.
